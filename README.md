# tweet-journaler
A simple utility to journal tweets into text files

If you've ever come across great tweets that you know you'll want to reference again, this is my solution. Sometimes tweets go away, or get lost in the firehose when you try to search for them later. Tweet Journaler makes it easy to get simple and readable plaintext journals of the ones that you pick out.

Call the app with the target tweet's URL after it (e.g. "python3 tweet-journaler.py https://twitter.com/OscarTheGrouch/status/1293263413200728064").

A text file is created for each twitter account, and the latest tweet is added to the bottom automatically.

Simple, open, readable.
